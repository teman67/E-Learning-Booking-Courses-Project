### Data Models

1. AllAuth User Model
    * Django Allauth, the User model is the default user model provided by the Django authentication system
    * The User entity has a one-to-many relationship with the Booking and Comment entities. This means that a User can have multiple Bookings and Comments, but each Booking and Comment is associated with only one User.

---

2. Course Model
    * Admin can add multiply courses in Course model. So users can see the courses and the relevent information on course list page.
    * Only Admin can change the data in the backend.
    * User can see the course information and image based on the chosen course.
    * Information provided is price, image,and description.
    * Course model has many to many relationship with Booking model. Therefore, each course offered on the platform can be booked by multiple users. This reflects the idea that a course can have numerous participants or bookings. Conversely, each booking made by a user can be associated with multiple courses. This means that a user can enroll in or book multiple courses.
    * Course model has one to many relationship with Comment model. it means that each instance of the "Course" model can have multiple associated instances of the "Comment" model. However, each instance of the "Comment" model is associated with only one specific instance of the "Course" model.
    * Each course can be booked by maximum 5 users.

---

3. Booking Model
    * A User can have multiple Bookings, but each Booking is associated with only one User. This is represented by the foreign key relationship between User and Booking.
    * Each user can book maximum 3 courses.
    * User cannot book a same course several times.
     
---

4. Userprofile Model
    * A User has one profile page with one to one relationship with User model.
    * All booked courses are shown to user.
    * Total price is calculated in the backend that is then displayed to user to show the total price of the booking.
    * Full CRUD functionality is available to the user.
     
---

5. Comment Model
    * Each user can comment on multiple courses, but each Comment is associated with only one User. This is represented by the foreign key relationship between User and Comment.
    * Full CRUD functionality is available to the user.

### Database Scheme

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

![DataScheme](/Erd/erd_1.png)

* The ERD image was created using [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/), 'django_extensions' app and pydot package. I followed the following steps to create the ERD image:
  - pip3 install graphviz
  - pip3 install django-extensions
  - Go to settings.py > add 'django_extensions', to INSTALLED_APPS
  - Add the following code
    GRAPH_MODELS ={
    'all_applications': True,
    'graph_models': True,
     }
    to settings.py
  - pip3 install pyparsing pydot
  - python3 manage.py graph_models -a > erd.dot && python3 manage.py graph_models --pydot -a -g -o erd.png

* This relationship diagram represents how different models are conneted to each other

## CRUD

CRUD functionality was implemented in both booking courses and commenting where:

- Create: An authenticated user can create a booking or leaving a comment.

- Read: A user can read the course information and comments .

- Update: An authenticated user can edit and update their own booked courses or comments.

- Delete: An authenticated user can delete their own booked courses or comments.

## Security Features

### User Authentication

* Django Allauth is a popular authentication and authorization library for Django, which provides a set of features for managing user authentication, registration, and account management.

### CSRF Protection

* Django provides built-in protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. CSRF tokens are generated for each user session, and they are required to submit forms or perform state-changing actions. When a user logs out, the session and associated CSRF token are invalidated, making it difficult for an attacker to forge a valid request using a copied URL.


### Custom error pages

* 404 Error Page, provides user with a button the redirect to home page.

Site is now live

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Please see  [TESTING.md](/readme/testing.md) for all the detailed testing performed.

### Automated Testing

I use TestCase from django.test to test my models.py, views.py, and forms.py. A summery of the testings is shown bellow where 74% part of my codes was tested using django test model. The report was generated by coverage as follow:
- pip3 install coverage
- coverage run --source=courses manage.py test

![Coverage report](/readme/Coverage_report.jpg)

The test files can be found in [courses folder](https://github.com/teman67/Project_4/tree/main/courses) named: "test_models.py test_forms.py test_views.py".

- To run these tests I changed the DATABASES in settings.py to local databases instead of external databases, otherwise the tests could not run due to permission problem.
- Totally 17 tests ran where I got the following output:  "..........E...F.." which shows 15 tests ran successfully.

## Fixed bugs

- Error Bad Request (400)
  * I got Bad request error (400) when I deployed on heroku. After checking different options I figured it out that this error came when I set DEBUG=False in settings.py. Finally the issue was solved when I changed <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static '/css/style.css' %}" /> to <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/style.css' %}" /> (removing / from path of style.css).

- When a user try to edit or delete booking of other users by copying the edit/delete URLs and pasting in web browser an error appears 
  * To solve the issue I added "if not request.user.is_authenticated: return redirect('home')" to both edit and delete class in views.py. Therefore, a user will redirect to the home page if he/she trys to edit/delete booking of others.

## Unfixed bugs

- In the login page there is link "Forgot your password?" which comes from nowhere! I could not figure it out the source of this link in my login template and I just changed the code so users redirect to 404 Page when they click on "Forgot your password?" link.
